# AI: Multi-Agent Pacman

This project is along the lines of the famous UC Berkeley AI project.
This is my implementation of the classic version of Pacman game with adversarial agents, such as ghosts. Utilizing Python, I will implement both Minimax, and Expectimax search techniques. Furthermore, I will also design an evaluation function.
